Correct head movements with cHPI
================================

.. include:: ../../../links.inc

.. important::

    This example requires the ``meg_wiki`` package to download the sample dataset. This
    package can be installed with ``pip``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install git+https://github.com/fcbg-platforms/meg-wiki

:ref:`Signal-Space Separation (SSS) and Maxwell filter
<data-analysis-pc:MaxWell filter>`\ :footcite:p:`sss_2005,tsss_2006` can be used to
compensate for head movements during a recording. To run SSS, you can use either MEGIN's
software on the :ref:`DANA <data-analysis-pc:MEGIN's software>` or
`MNE-Python <mne stable_>`_'s implementation.

.. tip::

    The enhanced version available in `MNE-Python <mne stable_>`_ is recommended. See
    :func:`mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter`. The fine calibration file and the
    cross-talk correction are available in the `sample dataset`_ (
    see :func:`meg_wiki.datasets.sample.data_path`).

Head Position Indicator (HPI)
-----------------------------

:ref:`Head Position Indication (HPI) <meg-session:HPI measurement>` is a technique to
measure the head position with respect to the MEG sensors. 5 coils are placed on the
participant head and digitized (see this
:ref:`section about digitization <meg-session:Digitization>`) in the head coordinate
frame. At the beginning of a recording, an electromagnetic pulse is delivered on the 5
coils at 5 unique frequencies. The coil position with respect to the MEG sensors is
estimated by measuring the magnetic field produced by this pulse on the MEG sensors.

The initial HPI measurement is used to determine the device to head affine
transformation matrix stored in ``raw.info["dev_head_t"]``.

    The figure below uses fsaverage MRI from `MNE-Python <mne stable_>`_'s dataset,

continuous Head Position Indicator (cHPI)
-----------------------------------------

If the recording is short, if the participant behaves and is focused on the task, one
can assume that the head remained still during the recording. In this case, the
initial device to head transformation estimated during the HPI measurement can be
assumed to be constant.

cHPI is a technique to continuously monitor the head position during the recording,
useful when the previous assumption does not hold. When cHPI is enabled, the 5 HPI
coils are continuously excited at 5 unique frequencies. The magnetic field produced by
the coils is measured by the MEG sensors alongside brain activity.

The signal produced by the HPI coils can be used to estimate the position of the 5
emitting coils at different time points, and thus to track the time-varying head
position.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-145

Estimating the head position
----------------------------

In `MNE-Python <mne stable_>`_, the head position is estimated through 3 steps:

- Estimate the cHPI amplitudes with :func:`mne.chpi.compute_chpi_amplitudes`
- Estimate the cHPI positions with :func:`mne.chpi.compute_chpi_locs`
- Estimate the head position with :func:`mne.chpi.compute_head_pos`

.. note::

    The function :func:`mne.chpi.compute_head_pos` returns an array of shape
    ``(n_pos, 10)`` containing the translations as ``(x, y, z)`` and the rotations as
    quaternions ``(q1, q2, q3)``. The translations and rotations can be converted to
    translation and rotation matrixes with :func:`mne.chpi.head_pos_to_trans_rot_t`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 145-150

.. code-block:: Python


    chpi_amplitudes = compute_chpi_amplitudes(raw)
    chpi_locs = compute_chpi_locs(raw.info, chpi_amplitudes)
    head_pos = compute_head_pos(raw.info, chpi_locs)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 151-153

The estimated head position can be plotted in function of time with
:func:`mne.viz.plot_head_positions`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 153-158

.. code-block:: Python


    plot_head_positions(head_pos, mode="traces")
    plot_head_positions(head_pos, mode="field")
    plt.show()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 159-173

Compensate head movements
-------------------------

Now that the head position at different timepoints, this information can be used to
compensate for the head movements during the recording. The function
:func:`mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter` uses the returned head positions in the
argument ``head_pos`` to apply the compensation and estimate the signal at every
sensor position as if the head was still, i.e., in the position measured by the
initial HPI measurement.

.. tip::

    It is important to first remove the cHPI signal from the recording and to mark
    bad channels.

Let's visualize the effect on a triplet of sensors located on the top of the head.
Note however that this represents the effect of SSS and movemvent compensation
together.

Magnetometers which are more sensitive to distant fields and thus to environmental
artifacts are more affected by SSS than gradiometers.

.. note::

    Note that on top of movement compensation, SSS can also transform the signal as if
    it was emitted from a different head position, through the argument
    ``destination``. This can be useful to compare signal between subjects in sensor
    space or to bring back a tilted head to a more upright position.
