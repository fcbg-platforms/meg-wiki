Manual sensor tuning
====================

In manual tuning, the channel response curve should be (1) a sinusoids with (2) as large
PTP amplitude as possible and (3) with the 0 from the Y-axis crossing at 1/3 from the
bottom.

The BIAS controls the amplitude and the shape to some degree, the OFFSET the Y-axis
crossing and the GATE controls the shape to some degree. The GATE should rarely be
modified.
