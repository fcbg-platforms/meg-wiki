# Status


To update current MEG status, you need to create a new column on the `log.csv` file.
Please keep more recent issues on top on the file.

On can add one of the following status logo:
    - :octicon:`clock;1em;sd-text-warning` for pending issues.
    - :octicon:`check-circle;1em;sd-text-success` for closed issues.
